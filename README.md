Boost Electronics Inventory and Marketing

Tailor Customer Engagement by Category: Use ratings and feedback data to improve customer experience for non-electronics items like Beauty and Clothing.

Promote Inclusive Marketingn by ensuring advertising and user interfaces are inclusive of all gender identities to maintain and grow the "Other" gender group engagement.
